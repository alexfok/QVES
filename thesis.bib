It actually is a completeness theorem for the class of distributed protocols with honest majority. Such completeness theorem is optimal in the sense that, if the majority of the players is not honest, some protocol problems have no efficient solution [C].},

The secrecy achieved is unconditional and does not rely on any assumption about computational intractability. Applications of these results to Byzantine Agreement are also presented.Underlying our results is a new tool of Information Checking which provides authentication without cryptographic assumptions and may have wide applications elsewhere.},

abstract = {We present a runtime environment for executing secure programs via a multi-party computation protocol in the preprocessing model. The runtime environment is general and allows arbitrary reactive computations to be performed. A particularly novel aspect is that it automatically determines the minimum number of rounds needed for a computation, given a specific instruction sequence, and it then uses this to minimize the overall cost of the computation. Various experiments are reported on, on various non-trivial functionalities. We show how, by utilizing the ability of modern processors to execute multiple threads at a time, one can obtain various tradeoffs between latency and throughput},

abstract = {Two novel visual cryptography (VC) schemes are proposed by combining VC with single-pixel imaging (SPI) for the first time. It is pointed out that the overlapping of visual key images in VC is similar to the superposition of pixel intensities by a single-pixel detector in SPI. In the first scheme, QR-code VC is designed by using opaque sheets instead of transparent sheets. The secret image can be recovered when identical illumination patterns are projected onto multiple visual key images and a single detector is used to record the total light intensities. In the second scheme, the secret image is shared by multiple illumination pattern sequences and it can be recovered when the visual key patterns are projected onto identical items. The application of VC can be extended to more diversified scenarios by our proposed schemes.},

abstract="In Eurocrypt 1994 we proposed a a new type of cryptographic scheme, which can decode concealed images without any cryptographic computations, by placing two transparencies on top of each other and using the decoder's (human) visual systems. One of the drawback of that proposal was a loss in contrast: a black pixel is translated in the reconstruction into a black region, but a white pixel is translated into a grey region (half black and half white). In this paper we propose am alternative model for reconstruction with a different set of operation (which we call the ``Cover'' semi-group) is proposed. In this model we are able to obtain a better contrast than is possible in the previous one.",
